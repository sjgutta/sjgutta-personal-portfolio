* Navigate to hw4 folder
* From base of folder, type make and code should compile
* This is assuming main.cpp and makefile are kept in hw4 base directory and class files are in
interpreter folder

## Running Code
* Compiling the code creates an executable called hw4
* run the code with ./basic_interpreter <filename>
* The <filename> represents the name of the file being used as input. Make sure it is in
this directory or if not, you specify the proper path
* The output will be printed to the terminal when the code is run, assuming a valid BASIC input
