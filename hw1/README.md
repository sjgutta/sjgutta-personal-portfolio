# Sajan Gutta - HW1 - README
## My code does not have any special requirements.
## Code compiles with g++ -g -Wall -std=c++11 the_rani.cpp -o rani
* This is assuming you are in same directory as the_rani.cpp
## For the file-reverser the same command above works
* just use g++ -g -Wall -std=c++11 file_reverser.cpp -o hw1q5
* This will run with any file as a second argument and output correctly to the terminal
* This is assuming the file is properly formatted
