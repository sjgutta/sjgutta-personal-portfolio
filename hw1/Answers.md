# More Git Questions
## Part A
* README.MD is unmodified assuming the repo was initiliazed with a README
## Part B
* README.MD is now modified and fun_problem.txt is untracked
## Part C
* Both files are now staged but not yet committed
## Part D
* Both files are now modified
## Part E
* README.MD is staged again while fun_problem.txt is now Unmodified and committed within its branch.
* The contents of fun_problem.txt are empty because we just checked out the version of the file out that was on the server. Since we never committed the addition of the "So far, so good" to the file, only an empty file is checked out. 
## Part F
* README.md now has some changes that staged for commit and also some changes that are not staged for commit. It is kind of like a combination of staged and Modified. This is because we staged the previous changes but never committed them. Since then, another changed was made but never staged. Thus, the different changes have been left in different states.
