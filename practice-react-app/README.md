# Practice React App

This directory contains the code for a practice application I built while learning React. I came into this project with a few years of web development experience and proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. This React application was built while working through "The Road to React: Your journey yo master plain yet pragmatic React.js." The book is written by Robin Wieruch and can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/Road-learn-React-pragmatic-React-js-ebook/dp/B077HJFCQX/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=react%20book&qid=1606535472&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExU0swNzFYWVo0TFQwJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNzYwODkzQUo3MjhNUVVQWEE4JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA3OTgzMjNKRUlETTk3NTg2V1Umd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl).
